# IntervalBeeper

## What It Does

This is a simple website that:

- Takes seconds as input
- Counts down the seconds
- When it reaches 0, a beep plays
- The counter then restarts

## Why It Does It

I use it as a reminder to correct my posture. 

## How You Can Do It

It doesn't work that well if you just open it as a static website. 
(The counter doesn't count properly when the website loses focus)
I suggest locally hosting it as a python server, the command to run the server is in the run.bat file.
